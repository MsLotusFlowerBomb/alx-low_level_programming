This project is based on C functions and nested loops.

0. isupper: Function that checks for uppercase character

1. isdigit: Function that checks for a digit.

2. Collaboration is multiplication: Function that multiplies two integers.

3. The numbers speak for themselves: print numbers from 0 to 9

4. I believe in numbers and signs: print numbers 0 - 9 skip 2 and 4

5. Numbers constitute the only universal language: print numbers 0-14 10 times

6. The shortest distance between two points is a straight line: function that draws a straight line in the terminal.

7. I feel like I am diagonally parked in a parallel universe: Draw a diagonal line on the terminal

8. You are so much sunshine in every square inch: function that prints a square: print a square.

9. Fizz-Buzz: print 0 - 100, multiples of 3 print fizz, multiples of five print buzz

10. Triangles: print a triangle

Additional tasks:

11. The problem of distinguishing prime numbers from composite numbers and of resolving the latter into their prime factors is known to be one of the most important and useful in arithmetic: find and print the largest prime factor.

12. Numbers have life; they're not just symbols on paper: print an integer.
